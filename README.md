A collection of Custom Stage views for OpenLP 2.94 AKA v3 RC1

# Installation instructions

Download the 'stages' folder above and copy it to the data folder of your OpenLP folder. Please include all the files.

Insure the 'Remote Plugin' is enabled. 

To use in OBS you need to use the 'Browser Source'. Point them the stage view url with the folder name inside 'Stage'

EG: If you want to view the lower third you would point to the following link.

  http://{yourremote}:4316/stage/LowerThird
  

OBS web sockets is not working at the moment. Updates to come.

Chords and video backgrounds are part of v3 so they have been removed
